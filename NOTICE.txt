Additional notice from developer:
The Apache License 2.0 applies to the entire app,
including the button icons obtained from

The Android versions of those buttons have been modified, as noted
within the drawable XML files. The files named "Contents.json" for iOS
have been modified by Visual Studio, but the PNG files remain unchanged.
